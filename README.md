# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP Test Project)

This is a basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a **Logistic Regression** model. It includes a simple **Streamlit** web interface where users can input a review and receive a sentiment prediction (Positive or Negative).

> ⚠️ This is a test project and serves as a prototype for future improvements.
